Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy warhorse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: <i>overland flight</i>,  <i>plane shift</i>,  and <i>ethereal jaunt</i>. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours.

The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours.

The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. <i>Ioun stones</i> have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.</p><table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" frame=\"VOID\" rules=\"ROWS\">\n\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td><b>Color</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Shape</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Effect</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Market Price</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Clear<br/></td>\n<td>Spindle<br/></td>\n<td>Sustains creature without food or water<br/></td>\n<td>4,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Dusty rose<br/></td>\n<td>Prism<br/></td>\n<td>+1 insight bonus to AC<br/></td>\n<td>5,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Deep red<br/></td>\n<td>Sphere<br/></td>\n<td>+2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity<br/></td>\n<td>8,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Incandescent blue<br/></td>\n<td>Sphere<br/></td>\n<td>+2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom<br/></td>\n<td>8,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Pale blue<br/></td>\n<td>Rhomboid<br/></td>\n<td>+2 enhancement bonus to Strength<br/></td>\n<td>8,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Pink<br/></td>\n<td>Rhomboid<br/></td>\n<td>+2 enhancement bonus to Constitution<br/></td>\n<td>8,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Pink and green<br/></td>\n<td>Sphere<br/></td>\n<td>+2 enhancement bonus to Charisma<br/></td>\n<td>8,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Scarlet and blue<br/></td>\n<td>Sphere<br/></td>\n<td>+2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence<br/></td>\n<td>8,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Dark blue<br/></td>\n<td>Rhomboid<br/></td>\n<td>Alertness (as the feat)<br/></td>\n<td>10,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Vibrant purple<br/></td>\n<td>Prism<br/></td>\n<td>Stores three levels of spells, as a <i>ring of spell storing</i><br/></td>\n<td>36,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Iridescent<br/></td>\n<td>Spindle<br/></td>\n<td>Sustains creature without air<br/></td>\n<td>18,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Pale lavender<br/></td>\n<td>Ellipsoid<br/></td>\n<td>Absorbs spells of 4th level or lower<sup><b>1</b></sup><br/></td>\n<td>20,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Pearly white<br/></td>\n<td>Spindle<br/></td>\n<td>Regenerate 1 point of damage per hour<br/></td>\n<td>20,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Pale green<br/></td>\n<td>Prism<br/></td>\n<td>+1 competence bonus on attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks<br/></td>\n<td>30,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Orange<br/></td>\n<td>Prism<br/></td>\n<td>+1 caster level<br/></td>\n<td>30,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td>Lavender and green<br/></td>\n<td>Ellipsoid<br/></td>\n<td>Absorbs spells of 8th level or lower<sup><b>2</b></sup><br/></td>\n<td>40,000 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"2\">\n<td colspan=\"4\">1 After absorbing twenty spell levels, the stone burns out and turns to dull gray, forever useless.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol=\"5\" curcol=\"2\">\n<td colspan=\"4\">2 After absorbing fifty spell levels, the stone burns out and turns dull gray, forever useless.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table><p>Regeneration from the pearly white <i>ioun stone</i> works like a <i>ring of regeneration</i>.

Like a psionic tattoo, a crawling tattoo can be scribed only with a power of no higher than 3rd level that targets one or more creatures. Exceptions are the <i>body adjustment</i> power, which can be scribed even though it affects only the manifester, and telepathy (compulsion) powers, which cannot be scribed at all. Powers that normally have an area affect only one target if scribed in a crawling tattoo. Powers with an experience point requirement cannot be scribed into a crawling tattoo. Otherwise, crawling tattoos are treated as psionic tattoos until they are activated by the wearer.</p><p>The wearer of a crawling tattoo can tap the tattoo as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, mentally specifying a target (to which the wearer must have line of sight). Instead of manifesting its stored power, the tattoo animates, drops to the ground, and scuttles toward the target. The original wearer need no longer concentrate on the tattoo once animated.</p><p>The animated tattoo moves toward its designated target in the same round when it is activated. Treat it as a Fine construct that has AC 18, 10 hit points, a hardness of 5, speed 30 feet, and a bonus on attack rolls equal to the wearer''s manifester level + his key ability modifier. Crawling tattoos, unlike true constructs, are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, teleport away, or otherwise absent itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is destroyed, a crawling tattoo shatters and evaporates.</p><p>A crawling tattoo must enter the target''s square to attack and thus provokes attacks of opportunity as it passes through the target''s threatened area. The tattoo makes one touch attack  per round thereafter until it strikes its target or is destroyed. On a successful attack, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the target if the target fails the appropriate saving throw; however, powers that normally allow a Reflex saving throw automatically affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial powers as well as harmful ones, and a target can allow the tattoo''s touch attack to succeed if he or she desires.</p><p>Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible.</p><p><i>Market Price:</i> The cost of a crawling tattoo depends on the level of the power scribed in it.</p><table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" frame=\"VOID\" rules=\"ROWS\">\n\n<tr maxcol=\"3\" curcol=\"3\">\n<td><b>Power Level</b><br/></td> <td><b>Market Price</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol=\"3\" curcol=\"3\">\n<td>1st<br/></td>\n<td>50 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"3\" curcol=\"3\">\n<td>2nd<br/></td>\n<td>300 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol=\"3\" curcol=\"3\">\n<td>3rd<br/></td>\n<td>750 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table><p><i>Crawling tattoo of concussion</i>: This crawling tattoo delivers a concussion effect, dealing 1d6 points of damage to a creature hit by its touch attack.</p><p>Faint psychokinesis; ML 1st; Craft Universal Item, <i>concussion blast</i>; Price 50 gp.</p><p><i>Crawling Tattoo of Energy Bolt</i>: Each of these tattoos is keyed to one energy type: cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.

The wielder specifies a target or targets within a 100-foot radius, ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a group of psionic beings that share the same philosophy. The nullification effect is accompanied by blasts of light, heat, and sound from the <i>Annulus</i>.
