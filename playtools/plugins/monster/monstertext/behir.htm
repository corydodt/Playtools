<h2>Behir</h2>
<p>The behir is a serpentine monster that can slither like a snake or use its dozen legs to move with considerable speed. A behir is about 40 feet long and weighs about 4,000 pounds. It can fold its limbs close to its long, narrow body and slither in snake fashion if it desires. The coloration of behirs ranges from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of gray-brown. The belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back over the head look dangerous but are actually used for preening the creature's scales, not for fighting.</p>
<p>Behirs speak Common.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>A behir usually bites and grabs its prey first, then either swallows or constricts the opponent. It can employ its claws only against foes caught in its coils. If beset by a large number of foes, it uses its breath weapon.</p>

<p><b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> A behir can try to swallow a grabbed Medium or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check.</p>
<p>A behir that swallows an opponent can use its Cleave feat to bite and grab another opponent.</p>
<p>A swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the behir's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.</p>
<p>A behir's gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents.</p>
