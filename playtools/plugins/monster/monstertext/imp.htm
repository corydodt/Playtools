<h3>Imp</h3>
<p>In its natural form, an imp stands almost 2 feet tall and weighs about 8 pounds.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Imps are craven, but not so timid as to pass up an opportunity for a surprise attack using their <i>invisibility</i> and alternate form ability. In its natural form, an imp attacks with the wicked stinger on its tail. It quickly flies out of reach if a foe manages to strike back effectively.</p>
<p>An imp's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Poison">
<p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex, secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Spell-Like Abilities">
  <p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>detect good</i>,  <i>detect magic</i>,
  <i>invisibility</i> (self only); 1/day-<i>suggestion</i> (DC 15); 
  1/week-<i>commune</i> (to ask only 6 questions, caster level 12th).
Caster level 6th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Alternate Form">
<p><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> An imp can assume other forms at will as a standard action. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself (caster level 12th), except that an imp does not regain hit points for changing form, and an individual imp can assume only one or two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms include monstrous spider, raven, rat, and boar.</p>
