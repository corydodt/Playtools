In its natural form, an imp attacks with the wicked stinger on its tail. It quickly flies out of reach if a foe manages to strike back effectively.</p><p>An imp's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><div level="8" topic="Poison"><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex, secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p>

Caster level 6th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p>Once per week an imp can use <i>commune</i> to ask six questions. The ability otherwise works as the spell (caster level 12th).</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Alternate Form"><p><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> An imp can assume other forms at will as a standard action.

Common forms include monstrous spider, raven, rat, and boar.</p><p/>
