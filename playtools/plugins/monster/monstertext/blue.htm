<h2>Blue</h2>
<p>Blues are a subrace of goblins with an innate knack for psionics. A blue is often smaller than an average goblin, standing just about 3 feet tall and weighing about 40 pounds. Blues have noticeably blue-tinged skin, and their eyes are less dull than those of a common goblin. Otherwise, they resemble their kin. They generally dress in short leather robes, dyed black.</p>
<p>Blues speak Goblin and Common.</p>
<p>Most blues encountered outside their homes are psions; the information in the statistics block is for a psion of 1st level.</p>
