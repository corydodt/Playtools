<div level="8" topic="Improved Grab">
<p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a temporal filcher must hit a creature of Large size or smaller with two claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and uses its time filch ability.</p>

<div level="8" topic="Psi-Like Abilities">
<p><b>Psi-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>chameleon</i>, <i>distract</i> (DC 13), <i>psionic dimension door</i>, <i>psionic levitate</i>, <i>wall walker</i>; 3/day-<i>mental barrier</i>. Manifester level 8th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Time Filch">
<p><b>Time Filch (Su):</b> If a temporal filcher successfully grapples a Large or smaller creature, it latches onto the opponent's body and shifts 7 minutes forward in time as a free action. Observers (if any) see the temporal filcher and its prey disappear in a shimmer, then reappear 7 minutes later in exactly the orientation and condition they left. For the filcher and its prey, no time passes at all. The victim must succeed on a Will save (DC 16) or be dazed for 1 round from temporal disorientation. The ability is otherwise identical to <i>time hop</i> manifested by an 8th-level manifester.</p>
