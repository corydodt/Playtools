</div><div level="8" topic="Magic Immunity"><p><b>Magic Immunity (Ex):</b> A mithral golem is immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except as follows. A <i>slow</i> spell negates its alacrity for 1d4 rounds, while a <i>haste</i> spell restores 1d6 hit points per level of the caster (maximum 10d6) or restores its alacrity, if previously negated by a <i>slow</i> spell. Multiple <i>slow</i> spells simply extend the duration of the effect.</p>

</div><div level="5" topic="Construction"><p><h5>Construction</h5></p><p>A mithral golem's body is sculpted from 8 1/2 tons of pure iron and is then polymorphed into mithral (using <i>polymorph any object</i>). A mithral golem costs 250,000 gold pieces to create, which includes 5,000 gp for the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft (armorsmithing) or Craft (weaponsmithing) check (DC 30). The creator must be 25th level, have the Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor feat, and be able to cast arcane spells. Completing the ritual drains 5,000 XP from the creator and requires <i>geas/quest</i>,  <i>haste</i>,  and <i>wish</i>.</p><p/>
