<h2>Leonal</h2>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Leonals like their battles as straightforward as can be. They begin with a roar to put their foes off balance, then follow up with a frenzy of claw and bite attacks. They closely coordinate with others in their pride, watching one another's flanks and setting up devastating attacks.</p>
<p>A leonal's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Roar">
<p><b>Roar (Su):</b> A leonal can roar up to three times per day. Each roar releases a blast in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of a <i>holy word</i> spell and deals an extra 2d6 points of sonic damage (Fortitude DC 20 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Pounce">
<p><b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a leonal charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Improved Grab">
<p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a leonal must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Rake">
<p><b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +20 melee, damage 1d6+8.</p>

<div level="8" topic="Lay on Hands">
<p><b>Lay on Hands (Su):</b> As the paladin class feature, except that each day, a leonal can heal an amount of damage equal to its full normal hit points.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Protective Aura">
<p><b>Protective Aura (Su):</b> Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the leonal. Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>,  both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals leonal's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a leonal's statistics block.)</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Speak with Animals">
<p><b>Speak with Animals (Su):</b> This ability works like <i>speak with animals</i> (caster level 8th) but is a free action and does not require sound.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Skills">
<p><b>Skills:</b> Leonals have a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks.</p>
