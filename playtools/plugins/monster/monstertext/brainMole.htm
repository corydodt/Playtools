<h2>Brain Mole</h2>
<p>Brain moles are burrowing animals that use psionic powers to overcome large psionic prey. Small, furry, and nearly blind, brain moles are almost indistinguishable from their common animal cousins.</p>
<p>Brain moles eat small insects when they can't get psionic energy.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Brain moles hunger for psionic energy. They hide in loose dirt and detritus on forest floors, watching for the approach of psionic creatures with their <i>detect psionics</i> power. When a suitable target comes in range, the brain moles then attack with their <i>power leech</i> ability. The moles remain hidden as long as possible. If threatened, they use <i>aversion</i> and <i>mind thrust</i> to discourage attackers, using their bite only as a last resort.</p>
