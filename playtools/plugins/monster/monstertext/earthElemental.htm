<body><div id="earthElemental" level="3" topic="Earth Elemental"><p><h3>Earth Elemental</h3></p><p/><p/><p>When summoned to the Material Plane, an earth elemental consists of whatever types of dirt, stones, precious metals, and gems it was conjured from.</p><p>Earth elementals speak Terran but rarely choose to do so.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Though an earth elemental moves slowly, it is a relentless opponent. It can travel though solid ground or stone as easily as humans walk on the earth's surface. It cannot swim, however, and must either walk around a body of water or go through the ground under it. An earth elemental can move along the bottom of a body of water but prefers not to.</p><div level="8" topic="Earth Mastery"><p><b>Earth Mastery (Ex):</b> An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Push"><p><b>Push (Ex):</b> An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given in Earth Mastery, above, also apply to the elemental's opposed Strength checks.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Earth Glide"><p><b>Earth Glide (Ex):</b> An earth elemental can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A <i>move earth</i> spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" frame="VOID" rules="ROWS" width="100%">
