<h3>Colossus</h3>

<h5>Construct Traits</h5>

  <p>Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns,
and morale effects), and to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death
effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save
unless it also works on objects. Cannot heal damage (though regeneration and
fast healing still apply, if present). Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal
damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Not at risk of death
from massive damage, but destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less;
cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft.</p>

<b>Magic Immunity (Ex)</b>

<p>A colossus completely resists most magical and supernatural effects, except
where otherwise noted below.</p>

<b>Antimagic Field (Ex)</b>

<p>A colossus constantly generates an antimagic field in a 100-foot-radius. The
field is an invisible barrier that is impervious to most magical effects,
including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise,
it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines,
except for the colossus’s own supernatural abilities. This effect is otherwise
as an antimagic field cast by a 25th-level caster.</p>

<p>A colossus’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.</p>

<h5>Construction</h5>
<p>The construction cost given for each colossus takes into account the physical body and all the materials and spell components that are consumed or become a permanent part of it. Except for the much tougher requirements, constructing a colossus is not unlike constructing a golem.</p>





<h2 id="ironColossus">Iron Colossus</h2>

<h5>Breath Weapon (Su)</h5>
<p>
	Cone of poisonous gas, 80 feet, as a free action every 1d4 rounds, initial damage 3d6 temporary Con, secondary damage 2d6 temporary Con, Fort half (DC 58). The DC is Constitution-based.

</p>

<h5>Magic Immunity (Ex)</h5>
<p>
	An iron colossus is immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except as follows. An electricity effect restores 1 hit point to the iron colossus for each 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal.
</p>

<h5>Rustproof (Ex)</h5>

<p>
	An iron colossus is not affected by rust attacks, unlike smaller iron golems.
</p>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>
	An iron colossus’s body is sculpted from 150,000 pounds of pure iron. The colossus costs 1,000,000 gp to create, which includes 100,500 gp for the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft (armorsmithing) or Craft (weaponsmithing) check (DC 42). The creator must be 35th level and able to cast epic spells. Completing the ritual drains 50,000 XP from the creator and requires polymorph any object.
