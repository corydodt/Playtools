A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Adventurers who have survived encounters with the creature often speak of the bestial madness they glimpsed in its red-rimmed eyes.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Owlbears attack prey-any creature bigger than a mouse-on sight, always fighting to the death. They slash with claws and beak, trying to grab their prey and rip it apart.</p><div level="8" topic="Improved Grab"><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, an owlbear must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p><p/>
