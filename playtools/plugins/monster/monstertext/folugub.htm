<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>A folugub can scent a crystal object up to 90 feet away, and once it has the scent, little deters it from its goal. It usually ceases attacking to devour a freshly liquefied crystal. The creature targets the largest crystal object available.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Liquefy Crystal">
<p><b>Liquefy Crystal (Ex):</b> A folugub that makes a successful touch attack with its tongue causes the target crystal to change phase, turning immediately from solid to liquid and becoming worthless. The touch can destroy up to a 5-foot cube of crystal instantly. Magic or psionic items made of crystal (including crystalline armor and weapons) must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save or be liquefied. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial modifier.</p>
<p>A crystalline weapon that deals damage to a folugub becomes liquefied immediately.</p>
