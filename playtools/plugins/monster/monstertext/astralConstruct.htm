<h1 class="title">Astral Construct</h1>

<p>Astral constructs are brought into being by the metacreativity power astral
construct. They are formed from raw ectoplasm (a portion of the astral medium
drawn into the Material Plane). The power points spent by the construct’s
creator during the manifestation of the power determine the level of the
astral construct created. However, even astral constructs of the same level
vary somewhat from each other, depending on the whims of their creators.</p>
<div class="section" id="combat">
<h1>Combat</h1>
<p>Astral constructs act as directed by their creators. As a free action, a
construct’s manifester can direct the construct to attack particular enemies,
use specific tactics or powers, perform other actions, or do nothing at all.
The construct does exactly what its creator directs it to do.</p>
<p>An astral construct generally appears as an animate clump of ectoplasm with a
vaguely humanoid shape, but the manifester can mold or sculpt one according to
his or her whim within the limits imposed by the creature’s size. The quality
of such “construct sculpture” is determined by a Craft (sculpting) check. A
result of 10 to 19 creates a creature that is recognizably similar to the
desired creature shape; a result of 20 to 29 creates a construct that looks
like an accurate portrayal of that creature type; a result of 30 or higher
creates a construct that looks like a specific individual. No matter how high
the Craft (sculpting) check result, though, an astral construct’s appearance
can’t hide the otherworldly material from which it is formed.</p>
<div class="section" id="construct-traits">
<h2>Construct Traits</h2>
<p>An astral construct has immunity to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning,
disease, death effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that
requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It
is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability
drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can
be repaired.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="special-abilities">
<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>Every time an astral construct is created, the manifester can choose to apply
one special ability to the construct. When the manifester begins to manifest
the astral construct power, he chooses one or more special abilities from a
menu of abilities appropriate to that level of astral construct.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-an-astral-construct">
<h1>Creating An Astral Construct</h1>
<p>When manifesting the astral construct power, the manifester assembles the
desired creature from a menu of choices, as specified in the construct’s
statistics block. A manifester can always substitute two choices from a lesser
menu for one of its given abilities. Multiple selections of the same menu
choice do not stack unless the ability specifically notes that stacking is
allowed.</p>
<p>Some menu choices grant an astral construct the ability to manifest specific
powers as psi-like abilities. Unless using the ability is a free action, an
astral construct manifesting such a power does so as a standard action that
provokes attacks of opportunity. All such powers have a manifester level equal
to the astral construct’s Hit Dice or the creator’s manifester level,
whichever is lower.</p>
<p>An astral construct does not need to meet the prerequisites for a feat granted
by a menu choice.</p>
