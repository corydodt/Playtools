<h3>Erinyes</h3>

<p>Erinyes speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Erinyes prefer to engage in combat from a distance. They use <i>charm monster</i> to distract or disorganize their opponents, then rain down fiery arrows from above.</p>
<p>An erinyes's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Entangle">
<p><b>Entangle (Ex):</b> Each erinyes carries a stout rope some 50 feet long that entangles opponents of any size as an <i>animate rope</i> spell (caster level 16th). An erinyes can hurl its rope 30 feet with no range penalty. Typically, an erinyes entangles a foe, lifts it into the air, and drops it from a great height.</p>
