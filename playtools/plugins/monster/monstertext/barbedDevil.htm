<h3>Barbed Devil (Hamatula)</h3>
<p>A barbed devil is about 7 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Barbed devils eagerly fight with their claws, trying to impale their opponents. They use <i>hold person</i> to immobilize those who avoid their hug attacks.</p>
<p>A barbed devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Fear">
<p><b>Fear (Su):</b> A creature hit by a barbed devil must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be affected as though by <i>fear</i> (caster level 9th).</p>
<p>Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by that same barbed devil's fear ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Impale">
<p><b>Impale (Ex):</b> A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Improved Grab">
<p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a barbed devil must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can impale the opponent on its barbed body.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Summon Devil">
<p><b><i>summon devil</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day a barbed devil can attempt to summon 1d6 bearded devils or another barbed devil with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Barbed Defense">
<p><b>Barbed Defense (Su):</b> Any creature striking a barbed devil with handheld weapons or natural weapons takes 1d8+6 points of piercing and slashing damage from the devil's barbs. Note that weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.</p>
</div>
