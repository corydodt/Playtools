<h2>Phasm</h2>
<p>A phasm is an amorphous creature that can assume the guise of almost any other creature or object. A phasm in its natural form is about 5 feet in diameter and 2 feet high at the center. Swirls of color indicate sensory organs. In this form, a phasm slithers about like an ooze and can attack with a pseudopod. It weighs about 400 pounds.</p>
<p>Phasms can speak Common but prefer telepathic communication.</p>

<p>If pursued or harassed, a phasm transforms into the most fearsome creature it knows and attacks. When seriously hurt, it changes to some fast or agile form and tries to escape.</p>
