 <h1>Snakes</h1>
 Snakes usually are not aggressive and flee when confronted.
 <h2>Skills</h2>

Snakes have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks and a +8 racial
bonus on Balance and Climb checks. A snake can always choose to take 10 on a
Climb check, even if rushed or threatened. Snakes use either their Strength
modifier or Dexterity modifier for Climb checks, whichever is higher. A snake
has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or
avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if
distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided
it swims in a straight line.

<h5>Constrictor Snake</h5>
<p>Constrictor snakes usually are not aggressive and flee when confronted.
They hunt for food but do not attempt to make a meal out of any creature that
is too large to constrict.</p>
<h6>Combat</h6>

<p>Constrictor snakes hunt by grabbing prey with their mouths and then
squeezing it with their powerful bodies.</p>

<b>Constrict (Ex)</b>

<p>On a successful grapple check, a constrictor snake deals 1d3+4 points of damage.</p>

<b>Improved Grab (Ex)</b>

To use this ability, a constrictor snake must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
<h5>Constrictor Snake, Giant</h5>

Giant constrictor snakes are more aggressive than their smaller cousins,
principally because they need a great amount of food to survive.
