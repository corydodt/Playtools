<h2>Porpoise</h2>

<div level="8" topic="Blindsight">
<p><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> Porpoises can 'see' by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A <i>silence</i> spell negates this and forces the porpoise to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a human's.</p>

<p><b>Skills:</b> A porpoise has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A porpoise has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.</p>
