<h2>Udoroot</h2>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>An udoroot can be killed only if its root is dug up or exposed, then burned, hacked apart, or otherwise destroyed. Severing or destroying all six crowns puts the plant out of commission, allowing excavation of the helpless root. The crowns are Medium objects with a hardness of 5 and 7 hit points. To sever a crown, an opponent must use the sunder action. The crowns can also be affected by spells or effects that affect an area or targeted by spells that affect an individual target.</p>
<p>An udoroot takes no damage from having a crown severed or destroyed. A severed crown dies and can no longer be used to attack, but the udoroot takes no other penalties.  As long as the root system remains intact, the crown regrows in about a month.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Double Manifest">
<p><b>Double Manifest (Ex):</b> An udoroot senses its surroundings and manifests its psi-like abilities through its crowns. It can manifest two psi-like abilities per round, as long as it has at least two crowns remaining.</p>
