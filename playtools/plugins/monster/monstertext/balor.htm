It weighs about 4,500 pounds.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Balors love to join battle armed with their swords and whips. If they face stiff resistance, they may teleport away to loose a few spell-like effects at the foe.</p><p>A balor's <i>+1 flaming whip</i> is a long, flexible weapon with many tails tipped with hooks, spikes, and balls. The weapon deals bludgeoning and slashing damage, in addition to fire damage.</p><p>A balor's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><div level="8" topic="Death Throes"><p><b>Death Throes (Ex):</b>When killed, a balor explodes in a blinding flash of light that deals 100 points of damage to anything within 100 feet (Reflex DC 30 half ).

</div><div level="8" topic="Entangle"><p><b>Entangle (Ex):</b> A balor's <i>+1 flaming whip</i> entangles foes much like an attack with a net. The whip has 20 hit points. The whip needs no folding.

The target remains anchored against the balor's body until it escapes the whip.</p>
