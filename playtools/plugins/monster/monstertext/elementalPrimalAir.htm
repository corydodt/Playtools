<p><b>Whirlwind (Su):</b> The elemental can transform itself into a whirlwind
once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD
it has. In this form, the elemental can move through the air or along a
surface at its fly speed.  A primal air whirlwind is 10 feet wide at the base,
40 feet wide at the top, and up to 80 feet tall. The elemental controls its
exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. Gargantuan or smaller creatures
might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and may be lifted into the air.
An affected creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 53) when it comes into
contact with the whirlwind or take 4d8 points of damage. It must also succeed
at a second Reflex save (DC 53) or be picked up bodily and held suspended in
the powerful winds, automatically taking 4d8 points of damage each round. A
creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save (DC 53) each round to escape
the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is
successful. The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes,
depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A summoned elemental
always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane. If the
whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris.
This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the
whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision,
beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those
farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed at
a Concentration check (DC 53) to cast a spell. The DC is Strength-based.</p>
