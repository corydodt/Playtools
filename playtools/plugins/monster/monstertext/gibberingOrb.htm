<h2>Gibbering Orb</h2>
<p>A gibbering orb can speak all languages.</p>
<p>A gibbering orb's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>The gibbering orb has the ability to bite its foes by extending a pseudopod with one of its mouths protruding from the end. The orb can extend four of these at any one foe, or a total of twelve in any given round. At the same time, the legions of eyes have the ability to cast a host of spells at a rapid rate.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Gibbering">
<p><b>Gibbering (Su):</b> The cacophony of speech emanating from the scores of mouths that make up the orb forces all within 60 feet of the creature to succeed at a Will save each round (DC 40) or suffer the effects of an <i>insanity</i> spell.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Improved Grab">
<p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, the gibbering orb must hit with a bite attack. If it gets a hold, the orb automatically deals bite Damage and can attempt to swallow whole.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Swallow Whole">
<p><b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> A gibbering orb can attempt to swallow a Large or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 4d8 points of constriction Damage plus 3d10 points of acid Damage per round. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using claws or a light slashing weapon to deal 20 points of Damage in a single blow (AC 16, damage reduction 10/epic still applies). Once the creature exits, the fluidlike body structure of the orb closes the wound; other swallowed opponents must cut their own way out. When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering orb absorbs the creature's known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like abilities. The orb can use any two of those abilities per round as a free action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray (see below) that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Eye Rays">
<p><b>Eye Rays (Su):</b> Two dozen of the eyes can each produce a magical ray each round, with each eye emulating a spell from among the list of spells below as if cast by a 27th-level caster. The save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed. However, a gibbering orb can never aim more than five rays at any single target, due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 150 feet. Each of these effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal parameters of the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target and requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are: <i>cone of cold</i>,  <i>disintegrate</i>,  <i>dominate monster</i>,  <i>energy drain</i>,  <i>feeblemind</i>,  <i>finger of death</i>,  <i>flesh to stone</i>,  <i>greater dispel magic</i>,  <i>harm</i>,  <i>hold monster</i>,  <i>horrid wilting</i>,  <i>implosion</i>,  <i>inflict critical wounds</i>,  <i>lightning bolt</i>,  <i>magic missile</i>,  <i>mage's disjunction</i>,  <i>irresistible dance</i>,  <i>polymorph any object</i>,  <i>power word blind</i>,  <i>power word kill</i>,  <i>power word stun</i>,  <i>prismatic spray</i>,  <i>slay living</i>,  and <i>temporal stasis</i>. </p>

<div level="8" topic="All-Around Vision">
<p><b>All-Around Vision (Ex):</b> The gibbering orb's many eyes give it a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Flight">
<p><b>Flight (Ex):</b> The gibbering orb's body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to fly as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent <i>feather fall</i> effect with personal range.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Amorphous">
<p><b>Amorphous (Ex):</b> A gibbering orb is not subject to critical hits. It has no clear front or back, so it cannot be flanked.</p>
