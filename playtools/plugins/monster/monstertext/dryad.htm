<body><div id="dryad" level="2" topic="Dryad"><p><h2>Dryad</h2></p><p>A dryad's delicate features are much like a female elf's, though her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons.</p><p>Although they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been encountered in one place on rare occasions.</p><p>Dryads speak Common, Elven, and Sylvan.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they are alluring-they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a dryad uses <i>charm person</i> or <i>suggestion</i>,  attempting to gain control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense.</p><div level="8" topic="Spell-Like Abilities"><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>entangle</i> (DC 13), <i>speak with plants</i>,  <i>tree shape</i>; 3/day- <i>charm person</i> (DC 13), <i>deep slumber</i> (DC 15), <i>tree stride</i>; 1/day-<i>suggestion</i> (DC 15). Caster level 6th. The save DCs are Wisdom-based.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Tree Dependent"><p><b>Tree Dependent (Su):</b> Each dryad is mystically bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad's oak does not radiate magic.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Wild Empathy"><p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> This power works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except that the dryad has a +6 racial bonus on the check.</p><p/>
