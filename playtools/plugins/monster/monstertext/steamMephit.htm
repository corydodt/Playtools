<h3>Steam Mephit</h3>
<p>Steam mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p>
<p>Steam mephits are bossy creatures who consider themselves the lords of all their kind. Each one is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 2 pounds.</p>
<p>Steam mephits speak Common and Ignan.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Unlike other mephits, steam mephits rush into combat eagerly, driven by an oversized ego.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Breath Weapon">
