<h3>Steam Mephit</h3>
<p>Steam mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p>
<p>Steam mephits are bossy creatures who consider themselves the lords of all their kind. Each one is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 2 pounds.</p>
<p>Steam mephits speak Common and Ignan.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Unlike other mephits, steam mephits rush into combat eagerly, driven by an oversized ego.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Breath Weapon">
<p><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> 10-foot cone of steam, damage 1d4 fire, Reflex DC 12 half. Living creatures that fail their saves are tormented by burned skin and seared eyes unless they have immunity to fire or are otherwise protected. This effect imposes a -4 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Spell-Like Abilities">
  <p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 1/hour-<i>blur</i> (an air mephit can surround
itself with vapor) (caster level 3rd).  The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Boiling Rainstorm">
  <p><b>Boiling Rainstorm (Sp):</b>1/day-it can create a rainstorm of boiling water that affects a
  20-foot-square area. Living creatures caught in the storm take 2d6 points of
  fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half; caster level 6th). This ability is the
  equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Fast Healing">
<p><b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> A steam mephit heals only if it is touching boiling water or is in a hot, humid area.</p>
