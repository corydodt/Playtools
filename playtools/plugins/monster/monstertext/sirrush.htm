</div><div level="8" topic="Headloss Resistance"><p><b>Headloss Resistance (Ex):</b> A sirrush's thick bony plate protects its neck like a shield and provides resistance from effects that could normally behead it, such as a vorpal weapon. When a sirrush or three-headed sir-rush would otherwise lose its head, it instead makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 HD of attacker + attacker's Str modifier). On a failed save, the sirrush's head leaves its shoulders normally, but on a successful save, the sirrush is unaffected by the beheading. A sirrush dies when beheaded; a three-headed sirrush goes on fighting until all its heads are lost (the only penalty it incurs is one or two fewer bite attacks when it makes a full attack).</p><p/>
