<h2>Derro</h2>
<p>Derro are afflicted by a form of racial madness, which most often manifests as delusions of grandeur coupled with an overpowering urge to inflict torment on other creatures. Derro are capable of holding their murderous impulses in check for short periods of time in order to cooperate with creatures of other races, but such arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks. Of course, no derro is capable of recognizing that he is out of his mind.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Derro are stealthy and bloodthirsty. They like to carefully arrange cruel traps and deadly ambushes, and strike savagely from hiding. They delight in taking captives who can be tortured to death later, and favor traps and poisons that disable without killing.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Madness">
<p><b>Madness (Ex):</b> Derro use their Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of their Wisdom modifier, and have immunity to <i>confusion</i> and <i>insanity</i> effects. A derro cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> spell.</p>
