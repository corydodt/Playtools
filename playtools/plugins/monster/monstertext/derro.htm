<h2>Derro</h2>
<p>Derro are afflicted by a form of racial madness, which most often manifests as delusions of grandeur coupled with an overpowering urge to inflict torment on other creatures. Derro are capable of holding their murderous impulses in check for short periods of time in order to cooperate with creatures of other races, but such arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks. Of course, no derro is capable of recognizing that he is out of his mind.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Derro are stealthy and bloodthirsty. They like to carefully arrange cruel traps and deadly ambushes, and strike savagely from hiding. They delight in taking captives who can be tortured to death later, and favor traps and poisons that disable without killing.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Madness">
<p><b>Madness (Ex):</b> Derro use their Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of their Wisdom modifier, and have immunity to <i>confusion</i> and <i>insanity</i> effects. A derro cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> spell.</p>
<p>*The racial madness of the derro provides a +6 bonus to their Charisma scores and a -6 penalty to their Wisdom scores. A derro restored to sanity gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.</p>

<div level="8" topic="Sneak Attack">
<p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex):</b> Any time a derro's opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, or if a derro flanks his opponent, he deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. This ability is just like the rogue's sneak attack and subject to the same limitations.</p>
