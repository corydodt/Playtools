<h2>Winterwight</h2>
<p>Winterwights speak Common and Infernal.</p>
<p>A winterwight's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<div level="8" topic="Rend">
<p><b>Rend (Ex):</b> If the winterwight hits with both of its claws, it latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 6d8+31 points of Damage.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Blightfire">
<p><b>Blightfire (Su):</b> When a winterwight deals Damage to a living opponent, a night-black flame begins to burn on the opponent's body. If the opponent fails a Fortitude save (DC 35), it takes 4 points of permanent Constitution drain. The opponent must continue to save every round for the next 4 rounds (5 rounds total) to avoid being permanently drained of an additional 4 points of Constitution per round. The creature regains 10 lost hit points whenever it drains 4 points of Constitution, gaining any excess hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the opponent is slain by blightfire, only icy fragments of the victim remain. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
</div>

<div level="8" topic="Cold Subtype">
<p><b>Cold Subtype:</b> Immunity to cold. Vulnerability to fire (takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure).</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Cold Aura">
<p><b>Cold Aura (Su):</b> A 10-foot-radius spread cold aura surrounds a winterwight. All creatures of the cold sub-type in the field (including the winterwight) are treated as if having turn resistance +6 (if undead) and fast healing 10. Creatures subject to cold Damage take 2d10 points of cold Damage each round they remain within the cold aura.</p>
