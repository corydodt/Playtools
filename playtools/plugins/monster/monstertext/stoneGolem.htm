<body><div id="stoneGolem" level="3" topic="Stone Golem"><p><h3>Stone Golem</h3></p><p>This golem has a humanoid body made from stone. A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Its body is frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Stone golems are formidable opponents, being physically powerful and difficult to harm.</p><div level="8" topic="Slow"><p><b>Slow (Su):</b> A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 17 Will save to negate. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Immunity to Magic"><p><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex):</b> A stone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p><p>A <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell slows a stone golem (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while <i>transmute mud to rock</i> heals all of its lost hit points.</p><p>A <i>stone to flesh</i> spell does not actually change the golem's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.</p>
