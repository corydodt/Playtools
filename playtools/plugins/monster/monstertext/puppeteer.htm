<p>Puppeteers use their psionic powers in conjunction with their enthrall ability to gain control over potential hosts. Once it is in control, a puppeteer almost exclusively relies on the host's mental and physical abilities, although it can use its own powers to enhance their effectiveness in a particularly dangerous situation.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Enthrall">
<p><b>Enthrall (Ex):</b> If a puppeteer is in physical contact with a person it has charmed (the puppeteer establishes a physical hold by means of slender infiltrating tendrils), the subject acts as if dominated. (Puppeteers often seek to charm victims first and then 'ask' to be picked up.) So long as the puppeteer remains in contact with the victim, the domination remains in effect, even if a check would normally indicate that the effect is broken.</p>
