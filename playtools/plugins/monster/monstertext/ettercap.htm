<body><div id="ettercap" level="2" topic="Ettercap"><p><h2>Ettercap</h2></p><p>An ettercap is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.</p><p>Ettercaps speak Common.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their cunning traps often ensure that the enemy never draws a weapon. When an ettercap does engage its enemies, it attacks with its keen-edged claws and venomous bite. It usually will not come within melee reach of any foe that is still able to move.</p><div level="8" topic="Poison"><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial damage 1d6 Dex, secondary damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Web"><p><b>Web (Ex):</b> An ettercap can throw a web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to Medium size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.</p><p>An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.</p><p>Ettercaps can also create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square. They usually position these to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web, or they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing receive a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.</p><p>An ettercap can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the exact location of any creature touching the web.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Skills"><p><b>Skills:</b> Ettercaps have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Hide, and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.</p><p/>
