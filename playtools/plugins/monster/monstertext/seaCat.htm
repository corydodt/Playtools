<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Sea cats attack on sight, either for food or to defend their territory, and use both claws and teeth to grab and rend their prey. They display tremendous courage, always fighting to the death, even against creatures many times their size. Pairs and prides of sea cats attack in concert, trying to wear the opponent down until one beast can dispatch it.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Hold Breath">
<p><b>Hold Breath (Ex):</b> A sea cat can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 6 ??its Constitution score before it risks drowning.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Rend">
<p><b>Rend (Ex):</b> A sea cat that hits with both claw attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This automatically deals an extra 2d6+6 points of damage.</p>
