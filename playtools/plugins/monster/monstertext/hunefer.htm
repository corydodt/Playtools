<h5>Combat</h5>
<div level="8" topic="Despair">
<p><b>Despair (Su):</b> The mere sight of a hunefer requires viewers to succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 48) or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Regardless of the outcome of the save, a subject is not again vulnerable to that hunefer's despair ability for 24 hours. The DC is Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Hunefer Rot">
<p><b>Hunefer Rot (Su):</b> Supernatural disease-slam, Fort save (DC 35), incubation period instantaneous; Damage 1d6 temporary Con. Unlike normal diseases, hunefer rot requires a victim to make a successful saving throw every round or take another 1d6 points of temporary Constitution Damage. The rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or receives a <i>remove disease</i> spell or similar magic. An afflicted creature that dies shrivels away into sand unless both <i>remove disease</i> and <i>raise dead</i> (or better) are cast on the remains within 2 rounds. If the remains are not so treated, on the third round the dust swirls and forms an 18 HD mummy with the dead foe's equipment under the hunefer's command. (The <i>mummy dust</i> epic spell has statistics for an 18 HD mummy.)</p>
