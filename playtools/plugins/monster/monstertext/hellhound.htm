<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Hell hounds are efficient hunters. A favorite pack tactic is to surround prey quietly, then attack with one or two hounds, driving it toward the rest with their fiery breath. If the prey doesn't run, the pack closes in. Hell hounds track fleeing prey relentlessly.</p>
<p>A hellhound's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
