<h2>Camel</h2>
<p>Camels are known for their ability to travel long distances without food or water.</p>
<p>The statistics presented here are for the dromedary, or one-humped camel, which thrives in warm deserts. A dromedary stands about 7 feet tall at the shoulder, with its hump rising 1 foot higher. The two-humped, or Bactrian, camel is suited to cooler, rocky areas. It is stockier, slower (speed 40 feet), and has a higher Constitution score (16).</p>
<div level="8" topic="Carrying Capacity">
<p><b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a camel is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds. A camel can drag 4,500 pounds.</p>
