Only their destruction can extinguish the glow, though they can try to hide it.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A lantern archon has little reason to get within melee range. It usually hovers just close enough to bring the enemy within its aura of menace, then blasts away with its light rays. Lantern archons prefer to concentrate on a single opponent, seeking to reduce enemy numbers quickly.</p><div level="8" topic="Aura of Menace"><p><b>Aura of Menace (Su):</b> Will DC 12 negates.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Light Ray"><p><b>Light Ray (Ex):</b> A lantern archon's light rays have a range of 30 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.</p>
