<h3>Quasit</h3>
<p>In its natural form, a quasit stands about 1-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 8 pounds.</p>
<p>Quasits speak Common and Abyssal.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Although quasits thirst for victory and power as other demons do, they are cowards at heart. They typically attack from ambush, using their alternate form ability and <i>invisibility</i> to get within reach, then try to scuttle away. When retreating, they use their <i>cause fear</i> ability to deter pursuit.</p>
<p>A quasit's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Poison">
<p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex, secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p>

<div level="8" topic="Alternate Form">
<p><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A quasit can assume other forms at will as a standard action. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself (caster level 12th), except that a quasit does not regain hit points for changing form, and any individual quasit can assume only one or two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms include bat, monstrous centipede, toad, and wolf. A quasit in alternate form loses its poison attack.</p>
