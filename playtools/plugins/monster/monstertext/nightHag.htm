<div level="8" topic="Dream Haunting">
<p><b>Dream Haunting (Su):</b> Night hags can visit the dreams of chaotic or evil individuals by using a special periapt known as a <i>heartstone</i> to become ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once a hag invades someone's dreams, it rides on the victim's back until dawn. The sleeper suffers from tormenting dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal intrusions, by confronting and defeating the night hag.</p>

<div level="3" topic="Heartstone">
<p/>
<h3>Heartstone</h3>
<p>All night hags carry a periapt known as a <i>heartstone</i>,  which instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a <i>heartstone</i> provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use <i>etherealness</i> until it can manufacture another (which takes one month). Creatures other than the hag can benefit from the <i>heartstone</i>'s powers, but the periapt shatters after ten uses (any disease cured or saving throw affected counts as a use) and it does not bestow <i>etherealness</i> to a bearer that is not a night hag. If sold, an intact <i>heartstone</i> brings 1,800 gp.</p>
