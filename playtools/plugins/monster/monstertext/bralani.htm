<h2>Bralani</h2>
<p>In addition to their natural form, bralanis can assume the shape of a whirlwind or zephyr of dust, snow, or sand.</p>
<p>Bralanis speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their <i>tongues</i> ability.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Bralanis prefer the scimitar and bow, the weapons of the desert nomads they most closely resemble.</p>
<p>A bralani's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

<div level="8" topic="Whirlwind Blast">
<p><b>Whirlwind Blast (Su):</b> When in whirlwind form, a bralani can attack with a scouring blast of wind, dealing 3d6 points of damage in a 20-foot line (Reflex DC 16 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Alternate Form">
<p><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A bralani can shift between its humanoid and whirlwind forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its whirlwind blast, but it can use its spell-like abilities and its weapons. In whirlwind form, it can fly, make slam attacks and whirlwind blast attacks, and use spell-like abilities.</p>
<p>A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani revert to any particular form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Tongues">
<p><b>Tongues (Su):</b> Bralanis can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <i>tongues</i> spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.</p>
