<body><div id="grick" level="2" topic="Grick"><p><h2>Grick</h2></p><p>An adult grick is about 8 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the end of its body and weighs some 200 pounds. Its body coloration is uniformly dark, with a pale underbelly.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Gricks attack when hungry or threatened. They hunt by holing up near high-traffic areas, using their natural coloration to blend into convenient shadows. When prey (virtually anything that moves) ventures near, they lash out with their tentacles. A grick's rubbery body seems to shed blows of any kind. Its jaws are relatively small and weak compared to its body mass, so rather than consume its kill immediately, a grick normally drags its victim back to its lair to be eaten at its leisure.</p><p>A grick's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Multiple gricks do not fight in concert. Each attacks the prey closest to it, and breaks off the fight as soon as it can drag dead or unconscious prey away.</p><div level="8" topic="Skills"><p><b>Skills:</b> A grick has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.</p><p>*Their coloration affords gricks a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks when in natural rocky areas.</p><p/>
