<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Yeth hounds hunt only at night. They fear the sun and never venture out in daylight, even if their lives depend on it.</p>
<p>A yeth hound's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

<p><b>Bay (Su):</b> When a yeth hound howls or barks, all creatures except other evil outsiders within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same hound's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
