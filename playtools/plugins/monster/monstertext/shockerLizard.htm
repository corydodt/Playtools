<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat. A lizard tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an opponent unconscious or when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard flees once it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are nearby, they all home in on their comrade's discharges and attempt to administer their shocks to the foe.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Stunning Shock">
<p><b>Stunning Shock (Su):</b> Once per round, a shocker lizard can deliver an electrical shock to a single opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals 2d8 points of nonlethal damage to living opponents (Reflex DC 12 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Lethal Shock">
<p><b>Lethal Shock (Su):</b> Whenever two or more shocker lizards are within 20 feet of each other, they can work together to create a lethal shock. This effect has a radius of 20 feet, centered on any one contributing lizard. The shock deals 2d8 points of electricity damage for each lizard contributing to it, to a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save (DC 10 + number of lizards contributing) reduces the damage by half.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Electricity Sense">
<p><b>Electricity Sense (Ex):</b> Shocker lizards automatically detect any electrical discharges within 100 feet.</p>
