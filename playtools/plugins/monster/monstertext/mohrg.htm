<h2>Mohrg</h2>
<p>Mohrgs are the animated corpses of mass murderers or similar villains who died without atoning for their crimes. Most mohrgs are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Like zombies, mohrgs attack by slamming enemies with their fists. They often catch opponents flat-footed, for they move much faster than zombies.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Improved Grab">
<p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a creature of its size or smaller with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Paralyzing Touch"><p><b>Paralyzing Touch (Su):</b> A mohrg lashes out with its tongue in combat. An opponent the tongue touches must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based.
</p></div>
<div level="8" topic="Create Spawn"><p><b>Create Spawn (Su):</b> Creatures
        killed by a mohrg rise after 1d4 days as zombies under the morhg's
        control. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in
        life.</p></div>
