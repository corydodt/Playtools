<h2>Gnome</h2>
<p>Gnomes stand 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Gnome males prefer short, carefully trimmed beards. Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500 years.</p>
<p>Gnomes speak their own language, Gnome. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders, tinkers, or adventurers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin.</p>
<p>Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p></p>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Gnomes prefer misdirection and deception over direct confrontation.</p>
<p>They would rather befuddle or embarrass foes (other than goblinoids or kobolds) than kill them.</p>
<p>Gnomes make heavy use of illusion magic and carefully prepared ambushes and traps whenever they can.</p>

<h3>Subraces</h3>
<p>The information above is for rock gnomes, the most common variety.</p>
<p>There are two other major gnome subraces, which differ from rock gnomes as follows.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Svirfneblin">
<p></p>
<h5>Svirfneblin</h5>
<p>Also called deep gnomes, svirfneblin are said to dwell in great cities deep underground.</p>
<p>A svirfneblin has wiry, rock-colored skin usually medium brown to brownish gray. Only males are bald; females have stringy gray hair. The average svirfneblin lifespan is 250 years.</p>

<li>-2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma. These adjustments replace the rock gnome's ability score adjustments.</li>
 <li>Stonecunning: This ability grants deep gnomes a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework. A deep gnome who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as though actively searching, and can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A svirfneblin can also intuit depth, sensing the approximate distance underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.</li>
 <li>Darkvision out to 120 feet and low-light vision.</li>
 <li>Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.</li>
 <li>+2 racial bonus on all saving throws (figured into the statistics for the character presented here). This trait replaces the rock gnome's racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.</li>

 <li>Automatic Languages: Undercommon, Gnome, Common. Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran. This trait replaces the rock gnome's automatic and bonus languages.</li>
 <li>Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day-<i>blindness/deafness</i> (typical save DC 13), <i>blur</i>,  <i>disguise self</i>. Caster level equals the svirfneblin's class levels. The save DC is Charisma-based and include a +4 racial modifier. This trait replaces the rock gnome's spell-like abilities.</li>

<h5>Forest Gnome</h5>

A very long-lived people, forest gnomes have an average life expectancy of 500 years.</p>
