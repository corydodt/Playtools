It weighs about 200 pounds.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>When a thoqqua is disturbed, its first instinct is to attack. Its favored tactic is to spring directly at a foe, either by bursting out of the rock or by coiling up its body and launching itself like a spring. (Treat this as a charge, even though the thoqqua does not need to move 10 feet before attacking.)</p><div level="8" topic="Heat"><p><b>Heat (Ex):</b> Merely touching or being touched by a thoqqua automatically deals 2d6 fire damage.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Burn"><p><b>Burn (Ex):</b> When a thoqqua hits with its slam attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save or catch fire. The save DC is Constitution-based. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds if not extinguished sooner. A burning creature can use a full-round action to put out the flame.</p><p/>
