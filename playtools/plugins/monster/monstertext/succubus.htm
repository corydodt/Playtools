<h3>Succubus</h3>
<p>A succubus is 6 feet tall in its natural form and weighs about 125 pounds.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Succubi are not warriors. They flee combat whenever they can. If forced to fight, they can attack with their claws, but they prefer to turn foes against one another. Succubi use their <i>polymorph</i> ability to assume humanoid guise, and can maintain this deception indefinitely. Their preferred tactic when dealing with heroes is to feign friendship and create an opportunity to be alone with one of them, whereupon the succubus applies her life-draining kiss. Succubi are not above taking on the role of a damsel in distress when encountered within a dungeon.</p>
<p>A succubus's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Energy Drain">
<p><b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> A succubus drains energy from a mortal it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. If the target is not willing to be kissed, the succubus must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. The succubus's kiss or embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a <i>suggestion</i> spell, asking the victim to accept another kiss from the succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 21 Will save to negate the effect of the <i>suggestion</i>. The DC is 21 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
