<div level="8" topic="Frightful Howl">
<p><b>Frightful Howl (Su):</b> As a standard action, a brachyurus can emit a howl in a 60-foot-radius spread that affects opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the brachyurus has. The affected creature must make a successful Will save (DC 33) or become shaken. Success indicates that the target is immune to that brachyurus's frightful howl for one day. The DC is Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Savage">
<p><b>Savage (Ex):</b> If a brachyurus successfully trips an opponent, it latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 15d6+25 points of damage. If an opponent goes prone for any reason in an area a brachyurus threatens, the brachyurus can also savage the victim as a free action (treat as the brachyurus's attack of opportunity for the round), even though it had nothing to do with tripping the foe.</p>
