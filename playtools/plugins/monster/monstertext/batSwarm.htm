<h3>Bat Swarm</h3>
<p>A bat swarm is nocturnal, and is never found aboveground in daylight.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>A bat swarm seeks to surround and attack any warm-blooded prey it encounters. The swarm deals 1d6 points of damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Distraction">
<p><b>Distraction (Ex):</b> Any living creature that begins its turn with a swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Wounding">
<p><b>Wounding (Ex):</b> Any living creature damaged by a bat swarm continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal check or the application of a <i>cure</i> spell or some other healing magic.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Blindsense">
<p><b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> A bat swarm notices and locates creatures within 20 feet. Opponents still have total concealment against the bat swarm (but swarm attacks ignore concealment).</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Skills">
<p><b>Skills:</b> A bat swarm has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsense is negated.</p>
