<h2>Cockatrice</h2>
<p>A male cockatrice has wattles and a comb, just like a rooster. Females, much rarer than males, differ only in that they have no wattles or comb. A cockatrice weighs about 25 pounds.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>A cockatrice fiercely attacks anything that it deems a threat to itself or its lair. Flocks of cockatrices do their utmost to overwhelm and confuse their foes, and sometimes fly directly into their opponents' faces.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Petrification">
<p><b>Petrification (Su):</b> Creatures hit by a cockatrice's bite attack must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or instantly turn to stone. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Cockatrices have immunity to the petrification ability of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect them normally.</p>
