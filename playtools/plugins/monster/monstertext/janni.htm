<h3>Janni</h3>
<p>The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane.</p>
<p>Jann speak Common, one elemental language (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran) and one alignment language (Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal).</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. If they meet a foe they cannot defeat in a standup fight, they use flight and <i>invisibility</i> to regroup and maneuver to a more advantageous position.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Change Size">
<p><b><i>Change Size</i> (Sp):</b> Twice per day, a janni can magically change a creature's size. This works just like an <i>enlarge person</i> or <i>reduce person</i> spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Spell-Like Abilities">
<p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day-<i>invisibility</i> (self only),
<i>speak with animals</i>; 1/day-<i>create food and water</i> (caster level
7th), <i>ethereal jaunt</i> (duration of 1 hour). Caster level 12th. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Elemental Endurance">
<p><b>Elemental Endurance (Ex):</b> Jann can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.</p>
