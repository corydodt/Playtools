<h3>Androsphinx</h3>
<p>These sphinxes are always male. Androsphinxes are clever and generally good-natured, but they can be savage opponents.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>In battle, an androsphinx rips apart enemies with its razor-sharp claws. It relies on its natural weapons in a fight, employing its spells for defense or healing.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Rake">
<p><b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +18 melee, damage 2d4+3.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Roar">
<p><b>Roar (Su):</b> Three times per day an androsphinx can loose a mighty roar. The first time it does this, all creatures within 500 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell for 2d6 rounds.</p>
<p>If the sphinx roars a second time during the same encounter, all creatures within 250 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds, and all those within 90 feet are deafened for 2d6 rounds (no save). If it roars a third time during the same encounter, all those within 250 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage for 2d4 rounds. In addition, any Medium or smaller creature within 90 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be thrown to the ground and take 2d8 points of damage. The force of this roar is so great that it deals 50 points of damage to any stone or crystalline object within 90 feet. Magic items and held or carried items can avoid damage with a DC 19 Reflex save. Other androsphinxes are immune to these effects. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
