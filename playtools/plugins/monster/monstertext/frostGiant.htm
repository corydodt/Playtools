<h3>Frost Giant</h3>
<p>A frost giant's hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes usually match its hair color. Frost giants dress in skins and pelts, along with any jewelry they own. Frost giant warriors add chain shirts and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers.</p>
<p>An adult male is about 15 feet tall and weighs about 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical with males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then wading in with their enormous battleaxes.</p>
<p>A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will have difficulty reaching them.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Rock Throwing">
<p><b>Rock Throwing (Ex):</b> The range increment is 120 feet for a frost giant's thrown rocks.</p>

<h4>Frost Giant Jarl</h4>
<p>A frost giant leader is often a barbarian, cleric, fighter, or sorcerer, but some of the most evil and ruthless frost giants become blackguards.</p>
<p>The frost giant jarl described here has all the qualities and abilities of a typical frost giant, as well as other abilities (see the statistics block) from being a blackguard. Details on some of these abilities follow.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Aura of Despair">
<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su):</b> This jarl radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Aura of Evil">
<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex):</b> This jarl radiates a strong aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil</i> spell) as an 8th-level cleric of an evil deity.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Command Undead">
<p><b>Command Undead (Su):</b> This jarl can command and rebuke undead as a 6th-level cleric.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Dark Blessing">
<p><b>Dark Blessing (Su):</b> This jarl applies his Charisma modifier as a bonus on all saving throws.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Detect Good">
<p><b><i>Detect Good</i> (Sp):</b> At will, this jarl can use <i>detect</i> <i>good</i> as a spell-like ability, duplicating the effect of the <i>detect</i> <i>good</i> spell.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Poison Use">
<p><b>Poison Use:</b> Blackguards are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Smite Good">
<p><b>Smite Good (Su):</b> Twice per day, this jarl may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. He adds his +4 Charisma modifier to his attack roll and deals 8 points of extra damage (1 per blackguard level) if the attack hits. If he accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day.</p>
