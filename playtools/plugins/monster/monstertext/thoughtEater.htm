<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>A thought eater can spend a maximum of 10 continuous rounds on the Material Plane before its wispy flesh finally dissipates and it falls dead. If badly wounded, it escapes to the Ethereal Plane rather than continuing the fight.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Eat Thoughts">
<p><b>Eat Thoughts (Su):</b> A thought eater can drain psionic power points with a successful melee touch attack. Each touch drains 6 power points from the opponent (or fewer, if the opponent has fewer than 6 points remaining). Against a nonpsionic creature or a psionic creature that currently has no power points, this touch attack instead deals 1 point of Intelligence damage, which provides nourishment equivalent to 6 power points.</p>
<p>A thought eater requires 12 power points per day to survive but will gorge itself on weak prey.</p>

<p>Manifester level 3rd. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>*Includes augmentation for the thought eater's manifester level.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Ethereal Jaunt">
<p><b>Ethereal Jaunt (Su):</b> A thought eater can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as part of any move action, and then shift back again as a free action. The ability is otherwise identical to the <i>psionic ethereal jaunt</i> power.</p>
