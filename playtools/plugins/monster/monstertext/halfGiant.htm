<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Because of their giant ancestry, half-giants are able to use weapons sized for creatures larger than normal humans. They gain considerable satisfaction in using these large weapons in combat against their foes.</p>

<div level="8" topic="Powerful Build">
<p><b>Powerful Build (Ex):</b> The physical stature of half-giants lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.</p>
