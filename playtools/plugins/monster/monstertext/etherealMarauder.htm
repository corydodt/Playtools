<h2>Ethereal Marauder</h2>
<p>Ethereal marauders live and hunt on the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal marauders' coloration ranges from bright blue to deep violet. An ethereal marauder stands about 4 feet tall, but its overall length is about 7 feet. It weighs about 200 pounds.</p>
<p>Ethereal marauders speak no known languages. Survivors of their attacks on the Material Plane claim that they emit an eerie, high whine that varies in pitch depending on the creature's speed and health.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Once a marauder locates prey, it shifts to the Material Plane to attack, attempting to catch its victim flat-footed. The creature bites its victim, then retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane. When badly hurt or wounded, a marauder escapes to its home plane rather than continuing the fight.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Ethereal Jaunt">
<p><b>Ethereal Jaunt (Su):</b> An ethereal marauder can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action. The ability is otherwise identical with the <i>ethereal jaunt</i> spell (caster level 15th).</p>

<div level="8" topic="Skills">
<p><b>Skills:</b> Ethereal marauders have a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks.</p>
