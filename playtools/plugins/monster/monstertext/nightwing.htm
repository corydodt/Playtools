<h3>Nightwing</h3>
<p/>
<p>Nightwings are batlike flyers that hunt on the wing.</p>
<p>A nightwing has a wingspan of about 40 feet and weighs about 4,000 pounds.</p>

<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Nightwings prowl the night sky and dive onto their victims. They are all but invisible, detectable only because of the stars they obscure in their passing.</p>
<p>A nightwing's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Magic Drain">
<p><b>Magic Drain (Su):</b> A nightwing can weaken magic armor, weapons, and shields by making a successful touch attack. The targeted item must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or lose 1 point of its enhancement bonus. The save DC is Charisma-based. An item that loses its entire enhancement bonus becomes merely a masterwork item and loses any special abilities (such as flaming) as well. Casting <i>dispel evil</i> upon the item reverses the effect of the magic drain, provided this occurs within a number of days after the attack equal to the caster's level and the caster succeeds on a DC 29 caster level check.</p>
