<h5>Construct Traits</h5>

  <p>Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns,
and morale effects), and to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death
effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save
unless it also works on objects. Cannot heal damage (though regeneration and
fast healing still apply, if present). Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal
damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Not at risk of death
from massive damage, but destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less;
cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft.</p>

<b>Magic Immunity (Ex)</b>

<p>A colossus completely resists most magical and supernatural effects, except
where otherwise noted below.</p>

<b>Antimagic Field (Ex)</b>

<p>A colossus constantly generates an antimagic field in a 100-foot-radius. The
field is an invisible barrier that is impervious to most magical effects,
including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise,
it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines,
except for the colossus&rsquo;s own supernatural abilities. This effect is otherwise
as an antimagic field cast by a 25th-level caster.</p>

<p>A colossus&rsquo;s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.</p>

<h5>Construction</h5>
<p>The construction cost given for each colossus takes into account the physical body and all the materials and spell components that are consumed or become a permanent part of it. Except for the much tougher requirements, constructing a colossus is not unlike constructing a golem.</p>

<p>
	A stone colossus cannot speak or make any vocal noise.
</p>

<h3>Combat</h3>

<h5>Shatter (Su)</h5>

<p>
	A stone colossus can use shatter (DC 37) as a free action once every 2 rounds against an opponent&rsquo;s weapon or other item as a 24th-level caster. The DC is Charisma-based.
</p>

<h5>Magic Immunity (Ex)</h5>
<p>
	A stone colossus is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as follows. A stone to flesh spell has no effect on a stone colossus.

</p>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>
	A stone colossus&rsquo;s body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at least 375,000 pounds. The colossus costs 760,000 gp to create, which includes 100,000 gp for the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft (sculpting) or Craft (masonry) check (DC 37). The creator must be 25th level and able to cast epic spells. Completing the ritual drains 30,600 XP from the creator and requires shatter.
