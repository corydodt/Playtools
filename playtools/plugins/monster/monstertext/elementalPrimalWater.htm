<h3>Primal Water Elemental</h3>
<p>A primal water elemental can't venture more than 360 feet from the body of
water from which it emerged. Water elementals speak Aquan.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<div level="8" topic="Water Mastery">
<p><b>Water Mastery (Ex):</b> A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and
damage rolls if both it and its opponent touch water. If the opponent or
elemental is land-bound, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage
rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.) A primal
water elemental can be a serious threat to a ship that crosses its path. It
can easily overturn even large craft (ships of up to 5 feet in length per Hit
Dice of the elemental) and stop massive vessels (ships of less than 10 feet in
length per HD). Even ocean-going behemoths (ships of less than 20 feet in
length per HD) can be slowed to half speed.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Drench">
<p><b>Drench (Ex):</b> The elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires,
exposed lanterns, and other open flames of non-magical origin if these are
Gargantuan or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as
<i>dispel magic</i> cast by a caster whose level equals the elemental's HD
total (64).</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Vortex">
<p><b>Vortex (Su):</b> The elemental can transform itself into a whirlpool
once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and remain in that form for
up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has (48 rounds). In vortex form, the elemental
can move through the water or along the bottom at its swim speed. The vortex
is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and up to 80 feet
tall. The elemental controls its exact height, but it must be at least 10
feet. Gargantuan and smaller creatures might take damage when caught in the
vortex and may be swept up by it. An affected creature must succeed at a
Reflex save (DC 58) when it comes into contact with the vortex or take 4d10
points of damage. It must also succeed at a second Reflex save (DC 68) or be
picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, automatically
taking 4d10 points of damage each round. A creature that can swim is allowed a
Reflex save (DC 58) each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes
damage, but can leave if the save is successful. The elemental can eject any
carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the vortex
hap-pens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before
returning to its home plane. If the vortex's base touches the bottom, it
creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental
and has a diameter equal to half the vortex's height. The cloud obscures all
vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have
one-half concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those
caught in the cloud must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 58) to cast a
spell.  The DC is Strength-based.</p>
