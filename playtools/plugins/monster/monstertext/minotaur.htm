<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Minotaurs prefer melee combat, where their great strength serves them well.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Powerful Charge">
<p><b>Powerful Charge (Ex):</b> A minotaur typically begins a battle by charging at an opponent, lowering its head to bring its mighty horns into play. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this allows the beast to make a single gore attack with a +9 attack bonus that deals 4d6+6 points of damage.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Natural Cunning">
<p><b>Natural Cunning (Ex):</b> Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to <i>maze</i> spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables them to track enemies. Further, they are never caught flat-footed.</p>
