An elasmosaurus has a total length of some 30 feet, including a tail half as long as its entire body, and weighs about 5,000 pounds. Observers who see only its head or tail might easily mistake it for a massive snake.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>An elasmosaurus is aggressive and attacks anything it notices.

When hunting, it travels with its head out of the water, snapping down quickly to seize prey.</p><div level="8" topic="Skills"><p><b>Skills:</b> *An elasmosaurus has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in water.</p><p/>
