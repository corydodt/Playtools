<h2>Bear, Polar</h2>
<p>These long, lean carnivores are slightly taller than brown bears.</p>

<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Polar bears fight just as brown bears do.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Improved Grab">
<p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a polar bear must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>

<div level="8" topic="Skills">
<p><b>Skills:</b> A polar bear has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A polar bear's white coat bestows a +12 racial bonus on Hide checks in snowy areas.</p>
