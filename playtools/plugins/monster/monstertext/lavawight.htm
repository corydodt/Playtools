<div level="8" topic="Rend">
<p><b>Rend (Ex):</b> If the lavawight hits with both of its claws, it latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 6d8+31 points of Damage.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Blazefire">
<p><b>Blazefire (Su):</b> Living creatures taking Damage from a lavawight's attack find themselves ignited with blaze-fire; they must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 35) or permanently lose 4 hit points. The DC is Charisma-based. The opponent must continue to save every round for the next 6 rounds (7 rounds total) to avoid being permanently drained of 4 more hit points each round. The lavawight heals the same amount of Damage whenever a creature is drained of hit points, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. Tehse temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If an opponent is slain by blazefire, only blackened ash remains of the victim. Hit points lost to the blazefire never heal naturally and cannot be magically restored-they are gone for good.</p>
