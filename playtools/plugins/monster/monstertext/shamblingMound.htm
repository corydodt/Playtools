<div level="8" topic="Improved Grab">
<p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a shambler must hit with both slam attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Constrict">
<p><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A shambler deals 2d6+7 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Immunity to Electricity">
<p><b>Immunity to Electricity (Ex):</b> Shamblers take no damage from electricity. Instead, any electricity attack used against a shambler temporarily grants it 1d4 points of Constitution. The shambler loses these points at the rate of 1 per hour.</p>
<p>Skills: Shamblers have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Move Silently checks. *They have a +12 racial bonus on Hide checks when in a swampy or forested area.</p>
