<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Magic Circle Against Evil">
<p><b>Magic Circle against Evil (Su):</b> This ability continuously duplicates the effect of the spell. A unicorn cannot suppress this ability.</p>

<p>A unicorn can use <i>cure light wounds</i> three times per day and <i>cure moderate wounds</i> once per day (caster level 5th) by touching a wounded creature with its horn.
