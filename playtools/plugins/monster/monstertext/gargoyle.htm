<h2>Gargoyle</h2>
<p>Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch indefinitely without moving and use this disguise to surprise their foes. They require no food, water, or air, but often eat their fallen foes out of fondness for inflicting pain.</p>
<p>Gargoyles speak Common and Terran.</p>
