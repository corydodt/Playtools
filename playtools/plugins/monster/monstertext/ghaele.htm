<h2>Ghaele</h2>
<p>A ghaele can take the form of an incorporeal globe of eldritch colors, 5 feet in diameter. A ghaele is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 170 pounds.</p>
<p>Ghaeles speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their <i>tongues</i> ability.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Ghaeles who enter combat prefer direct confrontation and damaging attacks to more subtle or insidious methods. They usually fight in their humanoid form, wielding incandescent <i>+4 holy greatswords</i>. If a ghaele desires mobility, it assumes its globe form and blasts the enemy with light rays.</p>
<p>A ghaele's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

</div>
<div level="8" topic="Gaze">
<p><b>Gaze (Su):</b> In humanoid form-slay evil creatures of 5 or less HD, range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates. Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell for 2d10 rounds. Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or suffer the <i>fear</i> effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Light Ray">
<p><b>Light Ray (Ex):</b> A ghaele in globe form can project light rays with a range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Alternate Form">
<p><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A ghaele can shift between its humanoid and globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it can fly, use its light rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal, and the ghaele has no Strength score while in that form.</p>
<p>A ghaele remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the ghaele revert to any particular form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell or ability, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Protective Aura">
<p><b>Protective Aura (Su):</b> Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, <i>this</i> ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the ghaele. Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>,  both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals ghaele's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a ghaele's statistics block.)</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Tongues">
<p><b>Tongues (Su):</b> Ghaeles can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <i>tongues</i> spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.</p>
