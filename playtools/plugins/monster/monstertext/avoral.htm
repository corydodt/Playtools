<h2>Avoral</h2>
<p>An avoral's bones are strong but hollow, so even the largest specimens weigh no more than 120 pounds. An avoral is about 7 feet tall. Each of an avoral's wings has a small hand at the midpoint. When the wings are folded, these appendages are about where human hands would be and can do nearly anything hands can do.</p>
<p>An avoral's visual acuity is virtually unmatched: It can see detail on objects up to 10 miles away and is said to be able to discern the color of a creature's eyes at 200 paces.</p>
<p>Avorals speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with almost any creature, thanks to their <i>tongues</i> ability.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>On the ground, an avoral can lash out with its wings to deliver punishing blows. However, it prefers to meet its foes in the air, where it can employ its talons and make full use of its aerial speed and agility. It can't make wing attacks while flying, however.</p>
<p>An avoral's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

<p><b>Fear Aura (Su):</b> Once per day an avoral can create an aura of fear in a 20-foot radius. It is otherwise identical with <i>fear</i> from an 8th-level caster (save DC 17). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>

</div>
<div level="8" topic="True Seeing">
<p><b>True Seeing (Su):</b> This ability is identical with <i>true seeing</i> (caster level 14th), except that it has personal range and the avoral must concentrate for 1 full round before it takes effect. Thereafter the ability remains in effect as long as the avoral concentrates on it.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Skills">
<p><b>Skills:</b> An avoral's sharp eyes give it a +8 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
