<body><div id="avoral" level="2" topic="Avoral"><p><h2>Avoral</h2></p><p>An avoral's bones are strong but hollow, so even the largest specimens weigh no more than 120 pounds. An avoral is about 7 feet tall. Each of an avoral's wings has a small hand at the midpoint. When the wings are folded, these appendages are about where human hands would be and can do nearly anything hands can do.</p><p>An avoral's visual acuity is virtually unmatched: It can see detail on objects up to 10 miles away and is said to be able to discern the color of a creature's eyes at 200 paces.</p><p>Avorals speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with almost any creature, thanks to their <i>tongues</i> ability.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>On the ground, an avoral can lash out with its wings to deliver punishing blows. However, it prefers to meet its foes in the air, where it can employ its talons and make full use of its aerial speed and agility. It can't make wing attacks while flying, however.</p><p>An avoral's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><div level="8" topic="Spell-Like Abilities"><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>aid</i>,  <i>blur</i> (self only), <i>command</i> (DC 14), <i>detect magic</i>,  <i>dimension door</i>,  <i>dispel magic</i>,  <i>gust of wind</i> (DC 15), <i>hold person</i> (DC 16), <i>light</i>,  <i>magic circle against evil</i> (self only), <i>magic missile</i>,  <i>see invisibility</i>; 3/day-<i>lightning bolt</i> (DC 16).
