As a result, they usually shun ranged weapons and rush to the attack, brandishing their stone battleaxes.</p><div level="8" topic="Blindsight"><p><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> Grimlocks can sense all foes within 40 feet as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, they treat all targets as having total concealment.</p><p>Grimlocks are susceptible to sound- and scent-based attacks, however, and are affected normally by loud noises and sonic spells (such as <i>ghost sound</i> or <i>silence</i>) and overpowering odors (such as <i>stinking cloud</i> or incense-heavy air). Negating a grimlock's sense of smell or hearing reduces this ability to normal Blind-Fight (as the feat). If both these senses are negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Immunities"><p><b>Immunities:</b> Grimlocks are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Skills"><p><b>Skills:</b> *A grimlock's dull gray skin helps it hide in its native terrain, conferring a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in mountains or underground.</p>
