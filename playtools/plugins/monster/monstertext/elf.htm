<p/>
<h2>Elf</h2>
<p>Elves average 5 feet tall and typically weigh just over 100 pounds. They live on fruits and grains, though they occasionally hunt for fresh meat. Elves prefer colorful clothes, usually with a green-and-gray cloak that blends well with the colors of the forest.</p>
<p>Elves speak Elven, and most also know Common and Sylvan.</p>
<p>Most elves encountered outside their homes are warriors; the information presented here is for one of 1st level.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Elves are cautious warriors and take time to analyze their opponents and the location of the fight if at all possible, maximizing their advantage by using ambushes, snipers, and camouflage. They prefer to fire from cover and retreat before they are found, repeating this maneuver until all of their enemies are dead.</p>
<p>They prefer longbows, shortbows, rapiers, and longswords. In melee, elves are graceful and deadly, using complex maneuvers that are beautiful to observe. Their wizards often use <i>sleep</i> spells during combat because these won't affect other elves.</p>

<div level="3" topic="Subraces">
<p/>
<h3>Subraces</h3>
<p>The above information describes the high elf, the most common variety. There are five other major subraces of elf, in addition to half-elves, who share enough elven characteristics to be included here.</p>
<p/>
<div level="5" topic="Half-Elf">
<p/>
<h5><b>Half-Elf</b></h5>
<p>Half-elves are not truly an elf subrace, but they are often mistaken for elves. Half-elves usually inherit a good blend of their parents' physical characteristics.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Half-Elf Traits">
<p><b>Half-Elf Traits (Ex):</b> Half-elves possess the following racial traits.</p>
<ul><li>Medium size.</li>
</ul><p>-A half-elf's base land speed is 30 feet.</p>
<ul><li>Immunity to <i>sleep</i> spells and similar magical effects, and a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.</li>
 <li>Low-light vision.</li>
 <li>+1 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. A half-elf does not have the elf's ability to notice secret doors simply by passing near them.</li>
 <li>+2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks: Half-elves get along naturally with all people. This bonus may not apply in situations or settings where half-elves are viewed with distrust.</li>
 <li>Elven Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered an elf. Half-elves, for example, are just as vulnerable to special effects that affect elves as their elf ancestors are, and they can use magic items that are only usable by elves.</li>
 <li>Automatic Languages: Common, Elven. Bonus Languages: Any (other than secret languages, such as Druidic).</li>
 <li>Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass half-elf takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing, her highest-level class does not count.</li>
</ul><p/>

<div level="5" topic="Aquatic Elf">
<p/>
<h5><b>Aquatic Elf</b></h5>
<p>Also called sea elves, these creatures are waterbreathing cousins to land-dwelling elves.</p>

 <li>An aquatic elf has a swim speed of 40 feet.</li>
 <li>Gills: Aquatic elves can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution (after that, refer to the suffocation rules).</li>

<div level="5" topic="Drow Elf">
<p/>
<h5><b>Drow Elf</b></h5>
<p>Also known as dark elves, drow are a depraved and evil subterranean offshoot.</p>
<p>White is the most common hair color among drow, but almost any pale shade is possible. Drow tend to be smaller and thinner than other sorts of elves, and their eyes are often a vivid red.</p>
<p>Drow usually coat their arrows with a potent venom.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Poison">
<p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> An opponent hit by a drow's poisoned weapon must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall unconscious. After 1 minute, the subject must succeed on another DC 13 Fortitude save or remain unconscious for 2d4 hours. A typical drow carries 1d4-1 doses of drow knockout poison. Drow typically coat arrows and crossbow bolts with this poison, but it can also be applied to a melee weapon. Note that drow have no special ability to apply poison without risking being poisoned themselves. Since this poison is not a magical effect, drow and other elves are susceptible to it.</p>

 <li>Automatic Languages: Common, Elven, Undercommon. Bonus Languages: Abyssal, Aquan, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Gnome, Goblin. This trait replaces the high elf's automatic and bonus languages.</li>
 <li>Light Blindness: Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a <i>daylight</i> spell) blinds drow for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area.</li>
