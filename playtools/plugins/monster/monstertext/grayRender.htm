It weighs about 4,000 pounds.</p><p>Gray renders are never found in groups. Each of these asexual creatures produces one offspring and carries it for a time in a pouch, but thereafter the young render must fend for itself.</p><p>A unique quality of the gray render is its tendency to bond with, protect, and provide for another creature (or group of creatures) native to its surroundings. Whether accepted or not, the render always attempts to remain fairly close, watching over its adopted charge(s) and daily bringing an offering of meat. It never willingly harms adopted creatures and retreats if they attack it.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A gray render attacks to kill, whether to bring down prey or to protect itself or those it has adopted. When hunting, it sometimes attempts to hide and wait for prey to wander close.</p><div level="8" topic="Improved Grab"><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a gray render must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Rend"><p><b>Rend (Ex):</b> A gray render that wins a grapple check after a successful bite attack establishes a hold, latching onto the opponent's body and tearing the flesh. This attack automatically deals 2d6+9 points of damage.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Skills"><p><b>Skills:</b> Gray renders have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks due to their six keen eyes.</p><p/>
