A cluster of nodules atop the main mass serve as sensory organs. The creature feeds and attacks with a gaping maw lined with rows of teeth. Four stumpy legs support the creature and allow it to move about. This ambulatory fungus is naturally invisible, making it a feared predator among subterranean inhabitants.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A phantom fungus usually roams quietly, hunting for prey. It attacks lone individuals almost anywhere, but when tackling groups it prefers an open space where it has a better chance .</p><div level="8" topic="Greater Invisibility"><p><b>Greater Invisibility (Su):</b> This ability is constant, allowing a phantom fungus to remain invisible even when attacking. It works like <i>greater invisibility</i> (caster level 12th) and lasts as long as the phantom fungus is alive. This ability is not subject to the <i>invisibility purge</i> spell. A phantom fungus becomes visible 1 minute after it is killed.</p>
