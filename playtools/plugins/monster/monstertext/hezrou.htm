<body><div id="hezrou" level="3" topic="Hezrou"><p><h3>Hezrou</h3></p><p>A hezrou can walk both upright and on all fours, but it always fights standing up</p><p>A hezrou is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 750 pounds.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Hezrous enjoy melee combat even more than vrocks do. They eagerly press an attack deep into the heart of enemy forces, so their stench can take effect as quickly as possible. They enter most battles by using <i>blasphemy</i>,  and follow it with an occasional <i>chaos hammer</i> or <i>unholy blight</i>,  depending on the alignment of their opponents.</p><p>A hezrou's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><div level="8" topic="Improved Grab"><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a hezrou must hit with both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Spell-Like Abilities"><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>chaos hammer</i> (DC 18), <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>unholy blight</i> (DC 18); 3/day-<i>blasphemy</i> (DC 21), <i>gaseous form</i>. Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Stench"><p><b>Stench (Ex):</b> A hezrou's skin produces a foul-smelling, toxic liquid whenever it fights. Any living creature (except other demons) within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures that successfully save are sickened for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same hezrou's stench for 24 hours. A <i>delay poison</i> or <i>neutralize poison</i> spell removes either condition from one creature. Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Summon Demon"><p><b><i>Summon Demon</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day a hezrou can attempt to summon 4d10 dretches or another hezrou with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Skills"><p><b>Skills:</b> Hezrous have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p><p/>
