They have been known to seize and carry off items enspelled with <i>daylight</i> spells.</p><div level="8" topic="Bay"><p><b>Bay (Su):</b> When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all creatures except evil outsiders within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same mastiff's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Trip"><p><b>Trip (Ex):</b> A shadow mastiff that hits with its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action (+3 check modifier) without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the shadow mastiff.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Shadow Blend"><p><b>Shadow Blend (Su):</b> In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow mastiff can disappear into the shadows, giving it total concealment. Artificial illumination, even a <i>light</i> or <i>continual flame</i> spell, does not negate this ability. A <i>daylight</i> spell, however, will.</p>
