The weapon can change form as he or she shifts from class to class, typically appearing as a bastard sword (one in each hand). When not in combat, the weapons simply do not exist, but leShay can 'draw' their weapons from nowhere as a free action. LeShay weapons are considered light weapons for a leShay, regardless of their size.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Superior Two-Weapon Fighting"><p><b>Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex):</b> A leShay fights with a leShay weapon in each hand. Because these weapons are extensions of its own body, the leShay does not take an attack or Damage penalty for attacking with two weapons.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Gaze"><p><b>Gaze (Su):</b> All creatures within 30 feet who meet the gaze of a leShay become affected as if by <i>charm monster</i>. A Will save (DC 53) negates the effect. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order. A leShay can also actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within range, who must then attempt a saving throw. LeShay are immune to their own gaze. The DC is Charisma-based.</p>
