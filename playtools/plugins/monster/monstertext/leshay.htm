<div level="8" topic="Leshay Weapons">
<p><b>LeShay Weapons (Su):</b> Each leShay carries two personal melee weapons that he or she manifests from his or her own life essence. The weapon can change form as he or she shifts from class to class, typically appearing as a bastard sword (one in each hand). When not in combat, the weapons simply do not exist, but leShay can 'draw' their weapons from nowhere as a free action. LeShay weapons are considered light weapons for a leShay, regardless of their size.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Superior Two-Weapon Fighting">
<p><b>Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex):</b> A leShay fights with a leShay weapon in each hand. Because these weapons are extensions of its own body, the leShay does not take an attack or Damage penalty for attacking with two weapons.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Gaze">
<p><b>Gaze (Su):</b> All creatures within 30 feet who meet the gaze of a leShay become affected as if by <i>charm monster</i>. A Will save (DC 53) negates the effect. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order. A leShay can also actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within range, who must then attempt a saving throw. LeShay are immune to their own gaze. The DC is Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Elf Traits">
<p><b>Elf Traits:</b> Immune to magic <i>sleep</i> spells and effects; +2 racial bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells or effects; low-light vision (can see twice as far as a human in low-light conditions); entitled to a Search check when within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door as though actively looking for it; Martial Weapon Proficiency (composite longbow, composite shortbow, longbow, longsword, and rapier) as bonus feats; +2 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, and Search checks (already figured into the statistics given above).</p>
