<h3>Marut</h3>
<p>Maruts confront those who would try to deny the grave itself.</p>
<p>Any who use unnatural means to extend their life span could be targeted by a marut. Those who take extraordinary measures to cheat death in some other way might be labeled transgressors as well. Those who use magic to reverse death aren't worthy of a marut's attention unless they do so repeatedly or on a massive scale.</p>
<p>When a marut has identified its target, it walks surely and implacably toward the foe, never resting.</p>

<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Once it has found its target, a marut brings it the death it has been trying to avoid. Those who defile death through necromancy may instead receive a <i>geas</i> and/or <i>mark of justice</i> to enforce proper respect. It typically uses <i>wall of force</i> to shut off any escape routes, then opens up with <i>chain lightning</i> while it closes to melee range. Once there, it strikes with its massive fists, using <i>circle of death</i> if beset by numbers of defenders. It hits spellcasting opponents with repeated uses of <i>greater dispel magic</i>,  and it uses <i>dimension door</i> and <i>locate creature</i> to track down foes who flee.</p>
<p>A marut's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Fists of Thunder and Lightning">
<p><b>Fists of Thunder and Lightning (Su):</b> A marut's left fist delivers a loud thunderclap whenever it hits something, dealing an extra 3d6 points of sonic damage and causing the target to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the deafness). Its right fist delivers a shock for an extra 3d6 points of electricity damage, and the flash of lightning causes the target to be blinded for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the blindness). The save DCs are Strength-based and include the marut's Ability Focus feat.</p>
