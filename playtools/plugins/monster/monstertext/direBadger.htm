<h3>Dire Badger</h3>
<p>These vicious creatures tolerate no intrusions. They cannot burrow into solid rock, but can move through just about any material softer than that. A dire badger usually leaves behind a usable tunnel 5 feet in diameter when burrowing unless the material it's moving through is very loose.</p>
<p>A dire badger is from 5 to 7 feet in length and can weigh up to 500 pounds.</p>

<p><b>Rage (Ex):</b> A dire badger that takes damage in combat flies into a berserk rage on its next turn, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, and -2 AC. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily.</p>
