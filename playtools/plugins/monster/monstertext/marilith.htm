<body><div id="marilith" level="3" topic="Marilith"><p><h3>Marilith</h3></p><p>A marilith usually holds a longsword in each of its six hands and wears many bangles and jewels.</p><p>A marilith stands about 9 feet tall and measures about 20 feet from head to tip of tail. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Though mariliths thrive on grand strategy and army-level tactics, they love physical combat and never pass up an opportunity to fight. Each of a marilith's six arms can wield a weapon, and the creature gets an additional three weapon attacks with its primary arm. Mariliths seldom rush headlong into battle, however, preferring to hang back and size up the situation first. They always seek to gain the best possible advantage from the local terrain, obstacles, and any vulnerability or weakness in their opponents.</p><p>A marilith's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><div level="8" topic="Constrict"><p><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A marilith deals 4d6+13 points of damage with a successful grapple check. The constricted creature must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or lose consciousness for as long as it remains in the coils and for 2d4 rounds thereafter. The save DC is Strength-based.</p>
</div><div level="8" topic="Improved Grab"><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a marilith must hit with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it succeeds on the grapple check, it can constrict.</p>
