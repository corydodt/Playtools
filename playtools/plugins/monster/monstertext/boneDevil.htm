<h3>Bone Devil (Osyluth)</h3>
<p>Bone devils stand about 9 feet tall and weigh about 500 pounds.</p>
<div level="5" topic="Combat">
<p/>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Bone devils hate all other creatures and attack ruthlessly. They freely use <i>wall of ice</i> to keep the enemy divided.</p>
<p>A bone devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<div level="8" topic="Fear Aura">
<p><b>Fear Aura (Su):</b> Bone devils can radiate a 5-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell (caster level 7th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same bone devil's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
</div>
<div level="8" topic="Poison">
<p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC</p>
<p>is Constitution-based.</p>
