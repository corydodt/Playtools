Kobolds speak Draconic with a voice that sounds like that of a yapping dog.</p><div level="5" topic="Combat"><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Kobolds like to attack with overwhelming odds-at least two to one-or trickery; should the odds fall below this threshold, they usually flee.

Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas.</p><div level="8" topic="Light Sensitivity"><p><b>Light Sensitivity (Ex):</b> Kobolds are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a <i>daylight</i> spell.</p>
