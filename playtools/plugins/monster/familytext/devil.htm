<p>Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.</p>
<p>
Many devils are surrounded by a <a href="/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fearAura">fear aura</a>, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with <a href="/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities">spell-like abilities</a> use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.
