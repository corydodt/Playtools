<p>A creature with the cold subtype has <a href="/srd/specialAbilities.htm#coldImmunity">immunity to cold</a>. It has <a href="/srd/specialAbilities.htm#vulnerabilitytoEnergy">vulnerability</a> to fire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a <a href="/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows">saving throw</a> is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.</p>
