<p>A subtype usually applied only to <a href="/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#outsiderType">outsiders</a> native to the evil-aligned Outer Planes. Evil outsiders are also called fiends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have evil alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on <a href="/srd/description.htm#alignment">alignment</a> affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the evil subtype overcomes <a href="/srd/specialAbilities.htm#damageReduction">damage reduction</a> as if its <a href="/srd/specialAbilities.htm#naturalWeapons">natural weapons</a> and any weapons it wields were evil-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</p>
