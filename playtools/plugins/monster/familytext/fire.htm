<p>A creature with the fire subtype has <a href="/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fireImmunity">immunity to fire</a>. It has <a href="/srd/specialAbilities.htm#vulnerabilitytoEnergy">vulnerability</a> to cold, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a <a href="/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows">saving throw</a> is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.</p>
