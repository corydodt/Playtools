<p>A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its original type. Some creatures (those with an inherited <a href="/srd/improvingMonsters.htm#templates">template</a>) are born with this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an acquired template. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature&#x2019;s original type. A creature with the augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type, but the features of its original type.</p>
